# Flight-Delay-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-2018-2024-
An end-to-end machine learning project that predicts whether a flight will be delayed using pre-departure information. The project covers data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and final evaluation, with a trained model saved for deployment.
